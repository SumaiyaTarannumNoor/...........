I'm also happy to get emails from moms who have read my articles saying, "I read your article and found it useful." I see these kind of the clients told me, "I used your article as a reference and went out with my kids!"

The reason I wanted to write about working this way was not only because it allowed me to get to have a reward for myself, but also to share information with other moms and dads who are having children. 
It makes me really happy to see that this work has such value.`}

There are a variety of writing projects available, and being able to work on multiple projects at the same time.

I would like to offer specific pieces of content to help develop my business skills, and I would like to gradually expand the scope of my work.

Until now, I have mainly been writing about company life, but recently I was chosen to write about M&A, which was very interesting. I would like to participate much more in writing about business experiences.

I've always wanted to work with numbers, so I'm really excited about this.

If you just steadily maintain a little courage and put in the effort, your path will open up. 
That's what I've learned through my work at ShufulY.`}
